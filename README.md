This repository contains a sophisticated Tetris solver program developed as a personal project. With meticulous algorithm design and implementation, the solver efficiently determines optimal placements for Tetris pieces on a dynamic game board.

# Description
The Tetris solver program is built using C++ and employs advanced techniques to solve the classic Tetris puzzle. By leveraging dynamic memory allocation and intelligent decision-making algorithms, the solver excels at strategically placing Tetrominos (Tetris pieces) on the game board.

The solver program offers the following key features:

Dynamic Game Board: The program supports game boards of varying rectangular sizes, providing flexibility in gameplay scenarios.

Solver Algorithm: The solver utilizes a powerful algorithm that carefully analyzes available options to determine the best positions for Tetrominos on the board. Hours of dedicated development have gone into creating an algorithm that optimizes the solving process.

Drawing and Animation: The solver includes a visually appealing drawing function that illustrates the Tetris board's current state. Additionally, an animation feature demonstrates the smooth descent of Tetrominos as they are placed on the board.
